                        <li>
                            <p>A boids game inspired by the artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986.
                                The program is object oriented and uses inheritance for the three classes. 
                                Sprites and vectors have been used.
                                Reynolds three rules are implemented and tuned so that the flocks move in a life like way.
                                There are three birdcages that work as obstacles for the boids.
                                There is a hoik appearing on screen that scares the boids away. It appears when 
                                the mouse is clicked.
                            </p>

                                A clone of the game "Mayhem". Title of the game May-hem giving the idea of "17th of may" (Constution
                                day in Norway) with a flag as a ship, shooting popcorn and hitting marching bands that play when they 
                                are hit util they dissapear (after 3 hits).
                                The program is object oriented and uses inheritance for the classes.Sprites and vectors have been used.
                                Ship with left and right rotation, thrust and shooting. Walls as obstacles in the game world.
                                Ship can crash with walls and window edge. Gravity acting on ship.Player score increasing and decreasing. 
                                Score printed in terminal when game ends.

                                A break-out game in a christmas edition. My very first game ever made!
                                The ball bounces of the walls and paddle (in a way that you can steer by hitting the left or
                                right side of the paddle). It breaks bricks by hitting them. When the ball falls down outside the 
                                paddle you loose, and when all bricks are removed you win.

        <div id="codecademy"><h3 id="text">Front-End path at Codecademy</h3></div>
        <p>
            I am currently studying the Front-End Engineer path via <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path">Codecademy</a>.
            Through these studies I learn how to build websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Basic design theory. 
            React and Redux. Test React with Jest and Enzyme. Functional and cross-browser tests with 
            Selenium. Deploy React app with Netlify. 
        </p>
        <p> I plan to reach the end of this Front-End path in December 2022.</p>
        <p>So far I have done some small projects that can be viewed in <a href="https://github.com/kj-develops"> GitHub:</a></p>

        </p>
        <h3>Other studies</h3>
        <p>I have a masters degree in Philsophy from 2009. My masters thesis 
            topic were existencial phiolosophy starting from the book called 
            "Om det tragiske" ("About the tragic") written by the Tromsø based 
            philosopher Peter Wessel Zapffe. My thesis (in Norwegian!) 
            can be read  <a href="https://munin.uit.no/handle/10037/2347">via 
                the research archive at UiT. </a>
            </p>
            <p>Before I went to the University I studied a year of photography 
                and at High School I studied music.</p>
